This example generates two layers of molecules in an xy plane of a
simulation box, each layer is placed at the distance of 1 (in reduced
units where the simulation box size is 10x10x10) from the box edges (i.e.,
at z=1 and z=9) as shown by the transparent planes in the snapshot. Note
that the -nm 1 option requires the utility to generate 1 bead in total
which is too little to generate the required layers, so the number is
increased and a warning is shown. Following is a verbose output of the
GenLayers utility (including the warning about too few beads specified):

 GenLayers out.vsf out.vcf -n 1 -nm 50 -g 1 -v

WARNING: too few beads to fit the required number of molecules!
         Number of beads increased to 300

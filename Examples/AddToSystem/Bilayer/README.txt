In this example, a bilayer is created composed primarily of one molecule type
(defined in A5B1.FIELD) with a 'notch' in one of the layer composed of a
different molecule type (defined in E5D1.FIELD). The bash script Bilayer.sh
creates the structure and fills the rest of the simulation box with pure water
on one side of the bilayer and water with salt on the other side (overall number
density of 3 was used in keeping witch classical dissipative particle dyamics).

The picture Bilayer.jpg shows the resulting simulation box with red and blue
beads representing the salt.

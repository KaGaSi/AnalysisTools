The script.sh shows how to create a Janus-like particle using the
AddToSystem utility.

In the first step, a system containing a single chain is created. Then in
steps two and three, the chain is surrounded by two different types of beads,
creating a Janus-like particle which is also saved into a FIELD-like output
file (as a 'molecule', but without any bonds) called mol.FIELD.

In the last step, mol.FIELD is used to populate a larger box with ten of
these particles. While the mol.FIELD could be adapted to add all ten
'molecules' at once (just change the number in the 'nummols' line), it is
better to add them one by one (i.e., calling AddToSystem multiple times)
since each new molecule can then be placed far from other molecules to
ensure there is no overlap.

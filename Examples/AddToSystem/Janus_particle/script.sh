# 1) create a seed molecule in the middle of a smaller box
#      The system is saved in 1.vcf and 1.vsf files; its box size is 10x5x5,
#      and the -cx/-cy/-cz options along with -gc option ensure placement of
#      of the molecule in the middle of the simulation box. The --no-rotate
#      option ensure the molecule is oriented exactly as defined by the FIELD-1
#      input file.

# 2) add first half-shells around the molecule
#      The beads added from FIELD-2 are placed at the distance of at least 0.2
#      and at most 2 from the seed molecule, and the -cx ensures the new beads
#      surround only part of the molecule.

# 3) add second half-shells around the molecule and save the result into a FIELD-like file as a single molecule
#      Again, the new beads are constrained to be at the distance of at least
#      0.2 and at most 2 from the seed molecule, while the -cx ensures their
#      placement around the still bare part of the molecule. The resulting
#      Janus structure is saved into mol.FIELD file as a single molecule (but
#      with no bonds) to allow placing the structure into other systems.

# 4) populate a box with structures from 3) via for loop to ensure they do not overlap.
#      At last, a new system is created in 4.vcf and 4.vsf files with box size
#      20x20x20 that contains 10 of the Janus structures. The structures are
#      added one by one with the first being placed completely at random and
#      the remaining nine added using a for loop at a distance of at least 6
#      from the centre of other structures to ensure no overlap between them.

TransformVsf utility {#TransformVsf}
=====

This utility takes `.vsf` structure file and DL_MESO input file `FIELD` and
transforms them into a different `.vsf` structure file that is well suited
for visualisation using VMD software.

Usage:

`TransformVsf <output.vsf> <options>`

> `<output.vsf>`
> > output structure file that must end with `.vsf`
> `<options>`
> > `-i <name>`
> > > use custom `.vsf` structure file instead of the default `dl_meso.vsf`
> > > (must end with `.vsf`)
> > `-b <name>`
> > > file containing bond alternatives to `FIELD`
> > `-v`
> > > verbose output providing information about the system
> > `-h`
> > > print help and exit

Format of output structure file {#TransformVsf-output}
=====

Every atom line in the generated structure file contains bead's index number,
mass, charge and name. Atom lines for beads in molecules also contain
molecule's id number and the name of the type of molecule. The bond section of
`output.vsf` lists all bonds one by one (i.e. no chains of bonds in the format
`<id1>:: <id2>` are used). Information about which bonds belong to which
molecule is provided as has comment. The file has the following format:
> `atom default name <name> mass <m> charge <q>`
>
> `...`
>
> `atom <id> name <name> mass <m> charge <q>`
>
> `...`
>
> `atom <id> name <name> mass <m> charge <q> segid <name> resid <id>`
>
> `...`
> 
> `# resid <id>`
>
> `<bonded bead id1>: <bonded bead id2>`
>
> `...`

For VMD atom selection:
> `segid <name>`
> > selects all molecules with given name(s)
> `resid <id>`
> > selects molecule(s) with given index number(s)
> `charge <q>`
> > selects all beads with given charge(s) (double quotes are required for
> > negative charge)
> `mass <m>`
> > selects all beads with given mass(es)

\todo Somehow avoid the need to use the special optional bond file, where
the ids of beads must strictly adhere to FIELD. Possibly require use of a
vcf file in conjunction with bond file

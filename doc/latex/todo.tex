Page \hyperlink{Common}{Common utilities} ]Optional bond file format\+: somehow avoid the need to use the special optional bond file, where the ids of beads must strictly adhere to F\+I\+E\+LD. Possibly require use of a vcf file in conjunction with bond file 

Join\+Runs\+: implement wholy {\ttfamily -\/-\/script} common option 

Completely change this -\/ either implement {\ttfamily -\/x} option or remove function {\ttfamily Write\+Coor\+Indexed} and hard code the writing to file

Density\+Aggregates\+: check if only chains in one aggregate are used -- anomalies in Van\+Der\+Burgh/\+Added\+Pol/

Gyration\+Aggregates\+: understand {\ttfamily jacobi} function

Gyration\+Molecules\+: implement using only selected bead types for calculation

Gyration\+Molecules\+: understand {\ttfamily jacobi} function

Gyration\+: move function from Gyration\+Aggregates and Gyration\+Molecules to a separate header file

Join\+Runs\+: base reindexing of beads in the second simulation on comparison between the two {\ttfamily .vsf} files 

Average\+: completely rewrite -\/ especially remove requirement for number of lines on the first line of input file

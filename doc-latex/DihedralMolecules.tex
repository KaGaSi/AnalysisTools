\section{DihedralMolecules} \label{sec:DihedralMolecules}

This utility calculates angles between specified planes in each molecule of
provided molecule type(s). The planes in a molecule are arbitrary, so they
can represent true dihedral angles or improper dihedrals.

The angle is specified by six bead indices (according to the order of beads
in the molecule in \texttt{vsf} -- similarly to the \texttt{-n} option in
\texttt{AngleMolecules}, Section~\ref{sec:AngleMolecules}). The
first three indices specify one plane and the next three the other. For
example, assuming indices \texttt{1 2 3 4 5 6}, the first plane is
specified by the first three beads in the molecule; second plane by the
next three beads (beads \texttt{4 5 6}). The default indices
(i.e., if \texttt{-n} option is not used) are \texttt{1 2 3 2 3 4}. More
than one angle can be specified (i.e., a multiple of six numbers can be
supplied to the \texttt{-n} option.).

The utility calculates a distribution for each specified angle for each
molecule type and prints overall averages at the end of \texttt{<output>}
file. If \texttt{-a} option is used, it also writes all the angles for
all individual molecules in each timestep (i.e., time evolution of the
angle for each individual molecule).

\begin{longtable}{p{0.235\textwidth}p{0.709\textwidth}}
  \toprule
  \multicolumn{2}{l}{Mandatory arguments} \\
  \midrule
  \texttt{<input>} & input coordinate file (either \texttt{vcf} or
    \texttt{vtf} format) \\
  \texttt{<width>} & width of each bin of the distribution (in degrees) \\
  \texttt{<output>} & output file for distribution \\
  \texttt{<mol name(s)>} & molecule name(s) to calculcate angles for \\
  \toprule
  \multicolumn{2}{l}{Non-standard options} \\
  \midrule
  \texttt{--joined} & specify that \texttt{<input>} contains joined
    coordinates (i.e., periodic boundary conditions for molecules do not
    have to be removed) \\
  \texttt{-a <file>} & write all angles for all molecules in all timesteps
    to \texttt{<file>} \\
  \texttt{-n  <ints>} & multiple of six indices for angle calculation
    (default: 1 2 3 2 3 4) \\
  \texttt{-st <int>} & starting timestep for calculation (default: 1) \\
  \texttt{-e <int>} & ending timestep for calculation (default: none) \\

Format of output files:
\begin{enumerate}[nosep,leftmargin=20pt]
  \item \texttt{<output>} -- distribution of angles
    \begin{itemize}[nosep,leftmargin=5pt]
      \item first line: command used to generate the file
      \item second line: calculated angles (the dash-separated numbers
        correspond to indices inside every molecule and are the same as the
        arguments to the \texttt{-n} option) with the numbers in brackets
        corresponding to $n$th column of data for each molecule type
      \item third line: numbering of columns (i.e., column headers)
        \begin{itemize}[nosep,leftmargin=10pt]
          \item first is the centre of each bin in angles (governed by
            \texttt{<width>}); i.e., if \texttt{<width>} is 5$^{\circ}$,
            then the centre of bin 0 to 5$^{\circ}$ is 2.5, centre of bin 5
            to 10$^{\circ}$ is 7.5 and so on
          \item the rest are for the calculated data: the range for each
            molecule type specifies which column numbers correspond to the
            calculated angles for that particular molecule type and the
            order of angles is given by the second line
        \end{itemize}
      \item last three lines: arithmetic means for each calculated angle
        (last line), headers (second to last line) that again give range
        of columns in the last line for each molecule type, and calculated
        angles (third to last line which is the same as the second line at
        the file beginning)
    \end{itemize}
  \item \texttt{-a <file>} -- all angles for all molecules in all timesteps
  \begin{itemize}[nosep,leftmargin=5pt]
    \item first and second lines are the same as for \texttt{<output>}
    \item third lines: column headers
      \begin{itemize}[nosep,leftmargin=10pt]
        \item first is simulation timestep
        \item the rest are the calculated data (in degreees): the range for
          each molecule type corresponds to the number of molecules of the
          given type times the number of calculated angles; for each
          molecule the angles are ordered according to the second line
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\section{AddToSystem} \label{sec:AddToSystem}

This utility takes an existing system specified by \texttt{vcf} coordinate
and \texttt{vsf} structure files and adds new beads into it. The new beads
replace neutral unbonded ones with the lowest indices (as ordered in the
\texttt{vsf} file) from the original system. If molecules are added,
\texttt{AddToSystem} places them at the end (for the sake of
\texttt{DL\_MESO} which requires molecules to be after unbonded beads). The
utility generates \texttt{vcf} and \texttt{vsf} files for the new system.

\texttt{AddToSystem} does not check whether there are enough unbonded
neutral beads to be replaced by the new beads; the utility will most likely
not show an error, but the resulting \texttt{vcf} and \texttt{vsf} files
won't be right.

Coordinates of the new unbonded beads are ruled by the \texttt{-ld},
\texttt{-hd}, and \texttt{-bt} options (either the first bead or the
geometric centre of the new molecules obey these options). The coordinates
of the remaining beads in a molecule are governed by the provided
coordinates. The molecules are added with a random orientation.

If \texttt{-ld} and/or \texttt{-hd} options are used, they must accompanied
by the \texttt{-bt} option.

The structure and number of added molecules and monomeric beads are read
from a \texttt{FIELD}-like file. This file must contain \texttt{species}
section followed by \texttt{molecule} section as described in the DL\_MESO
simulation package.

The \texttt{species} section contains the number of bead types and their
properties:
\begin{verbatim}
  species <int>
  <name>  <mass> <charge> <number of unbonded beads>
\end{verbatim}
The first line must start with \texttt{species} keyword followed by the
number of bead types. For each bead type a single line must contain the name of
the bead, its mass and charge, and a number of these beads that are not
in a molecule (i.e., monomeric beads).

The \texttt{molecule} section that must be behind the \texttt{species}
section contains information about structure and numbers of molecules to be
added:

\noindent
\begin{longtable}{ll}
  \texttt{molecule <int>} & Number of types of molecules \\
  \texttt{<name>} & Name of the first molecule type \\
  \texttt{nummols <int>} & Number of these molecules \\
  \texttt{beads <int>} & Number of beads in these molecules \\
  \texttt{<bead name> <float> <float> <float>} & One line for each of the \texttt{<int>} beads \\
  \texttt{...} & \ \ \ \ specifying bead name and its \\
  \texttt{<bead name> <float> <float> <float>} & \ \ \ \ Cartesian coordinates \\
  \texttt{bonds <int>} & Number of bonds in these molecules \\
  \texttt{<string> <int> <int>} & One line for each of the \texttt{<int>} bonds \\
  \texttt{...} & \ \ \ \ containing arbitrary string and \\
  \texttt{<string> <int> <int>} & \ \ \ \ indices connected beads \\
  \texttt{...} & Anything beyond here is ignored \\
  \texttt{finish} & Description of a molecule is finished \\
\end{longtable}

The \texttt{molecule} keyword specifies the number of molecule types, that
is the number of \texttt{finish} keywords that must be present. The
\texttt{<bead name>} must be present in the \texttt{species} section. The
arbitrary \texttt{<string>} in the \texttt{bonds} is ignored by
\texttt{AddToSystem} (it is a relic from the \texttt{DL\_MESO} simulation
package, where the \texttt{<string>} specifies a type of bond). The indices
in \texttt{bond} lines run from 1 to the number of beads in the molecules and are
ordered according to the \texttt{beads} part of the section. Because
\texttt{molecule} section in the \texttt{FIELD} file from \texttt{DL\_MESO}
can also include bond angles and dihedral angles, anything beyond the last
bond line is ignored (until the \texttt{finish} keyword is read).

If no molecules are to be added, the line \texttt{molecule 0} must be still
be present in the file.

The following is an example of the \texttt{FIELD}-like file:
\begin{verbatim}
  species 3
  A   1.0  1.0  0
  B   1.0  0.0  0
  CI  1.0 -1.0 30

  molecule 2
  Dimer
  nummols 10
  beads 2
  A 0.0 0.0 0.0
  A 0.5 0.0 0.0
  bonds 1
  harm 1 2
  finish
  surfact
  nummols 10
  beads 3
  A 0.0 0.0 0.0
  B 0.5 0.0 0.0
  B 1.0 0.0 0.0
  bonds 2
  harm 1 2
  harm 2 3
  angles 1
  harm 1 2 3
  finish
\end{verbatim}
In this example, 30 unbonded (or monomeric) negatively charged beads called
\texttt{CI} are added as well as 20 molecules -- 10 molecules called
\texttt{Dimer} and 10 molecules called \texttt{surfact}. \texttt{Dimer}
molecules contain two \texttt{A} beads and one bond each; \texttt{surfact}
molecules contain three beads and two bonds each. The part starting with
\texttt{angles} and ending with \texttt{finish} is ignored. All in all, 80
beads are added -- 30 \texttt{CI}, 30 \texttt{A}, and 20 \texttt{B} beads.

The utility creates the \texttt{vcf} and \texttt{vsf} files with the new
system and can also write the coordinates into a \texttt{xyz} file.

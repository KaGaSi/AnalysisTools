All programs can be compiled on linux using \texttt{cmake}, which generates
\texttt{Makefile}, and subsequently running \texttt{make}. It requires
\texttt{C} and \texttt{FORTRAN} compilers.

The compilation should be done in a separate directory, such as
\texttt{\$ROOT\_DIR/build} (\texttt{\$ROOT\_DIR} is the
\texttt{AnalysisTools} root directory). To create the \texttt{Makefile},
simply run \texttt{cmake \$ROOT\_DIR} in the \texttt{build} directory.  All
utilities are then compiled by running \texttt{make} without any arguments.
To compile individual utilities, run \texttt{make <utility name>}.
The binaries will be in \texttt{build/bin} directory.

Following is a one line command to create the \texttt{build} directory and
compile all utilities (assuming the working directory is AnalysisTools root
directory):

\texttt{mkdir build; cd build; cmake ../; make}

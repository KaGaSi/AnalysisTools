All programs can be compiled on linux using \texttt{cmake} which generates
\texttt{Makefile} and subsequently running \texttt{make}. It requires
\texttt{C} and \texttt{FORTRAN} compilers.  The compilation should be done
in a separate directory, such as \texttt{build}.

To create the \texttt{Makefile}, simply run \texttt{cmake \$ROOT\_DIR} in
the separate directory, where \texttt{\$ROOT\_DIR} is the
\texttt{AnalysisTools} root directory.  All utilities can be then compiled
by simply running \texttt{make} without any arguments. To compile
individual utilities, simply run \texttt{make <utility name>}. The binaries
will be in \texttt{build/bin} directory.

Individual utilities can also be compiled without the use of \texttt{cmake}
(and without \texttt{Makefile}) by using
\texttt{gcc -O3 -lm \$ROOT\_DIR/AnalysisTools.c \$ROOT\_DIR/Error.c}\\
\texttt{\$ROOT\_DIR/Options.c \$ROOT\_DIR/Utility/program.c}.

\section{traject} \label{sec:traject}

This utility is from the DL\_MESO simulation package and comes in three
versions for 2.5, 2.6, and 2.7 versions of DL\_MESO. For the latest DL\_MESO
version, the utility is unmodified and therefore is not included here. The
utilities \texttt{traject-v2\_5} and \texttt{traject-v2\_6} shipped with
DL\_MESO 2.5 and 2.6 were modified to generate separate \texttt{vsf} and
\texttt{vcf} file (the \texttt{traject.exe} for DL\_MESO 2.7 does this
natively with \texttt{-sc} command line option).

Usage of 2.5 and 2.6 versions (see DL\_MESO manual for the description of
latest version):

\texttt{traject-v2\_5 <int>} or \texttt{traject-v2\_6 <int>}

  \midrule
  \texttt{<int>} & number of computer cores used for the simulation run
    (equals the number of \texttt{HISTORY} files) \\

\section{JoinRuns} \label{sec:JoinRuns}

{\it This utility may not work correctly.}

This utility joins two independent simulation runs of the same system.
That is, the system contains identical beads and molecules, but these beads
and molecules are numbered differently in the \texttt{vsf} and \texttt{vcf}
files from different simulations. The two input \texttt{vcf} files must
contain the same timestep type (i.e., both indexed or both ordered) and the
same number of beads (i.e., if one bead type is absent from one
\texttt{vcf} file, it must be absent from the second one as well).

The output is a \texttt{vcf} coordinate file with beads indexed according
to the first \texttt{vsf} structure file (i.e., \texttt{traject.vsf} or
provided by \texttt{-i} option).

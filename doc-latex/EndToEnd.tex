\section{EndToEnd} \label{sec:EndToEnd}

This utility is aimed at linear chains and calculates end-to-end distance
for specified molecule type(s), i.e., the distance between the first and
last bead (as they are defined in the first molecule of the given type in
\texttt{vsf}).

Right now, the \texttt{EndToEnd} requires \texttt{<input>} to contain
coordinates with joined molecules (i.e., without periodic boundary
conditions).

The \texttt{<output>} file contains per-timestep averages of end-to-end distance for each
specified molecule type.

Usage:

\noindent
\texttt{EndToEnd <input> <output> <mol name(s)> <options>}

\begin{longtable}{p{0.235\textwidth}p{0.709\textwidth}}
  \toprule
  \multicolumn{2}{l}{Mandatory arguments} \\
  \midrule
  \texttt{<input>} & input coordinate file with joined coordinates (either
    \texttt{vcf} or \texttt{vtf} format) \\
  \texttt{<output>} & output file name with end-to-end data \\
  \texttt{<mol name(s)>} & molecule name(s) to calculcate end-to-end
    distance for \\
  \bottomrule
\end{longtable}

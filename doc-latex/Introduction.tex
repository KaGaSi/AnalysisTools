\chapter{Introdution}

This set of utilities analyses trajectories of particle-based simulations.
The emphasis is on assembly of molecules such as self-assembly of polymers
and the properties of the resultant aggregates. Note that throughout the
utilities and this manual, the term aggregates refers to any supramolecular
structure (e.g., a bilayer, a micelle, or a vesicle).

The package also contains some utilities to generate initial configurations
(or adapt existing) as well as to create input files for the
\href{https://lammps.sandia.gov/}{LAMMPS molecular dynamic simulator} and
the \href{https://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/DL_MESO.aspx}{DL\_MESO
simulation package}.

It mainly works with
\href{https://github.com/olenz/vtfplugin/wiki/VTF-format}{vtf trajectory
files}, but it can also read \texttt{xyz} or LAMMPS custom format
coordinate files as well as configuration files for LAMMPS and DL\_MESO
simulation package.

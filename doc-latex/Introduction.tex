\chapter{Introdution}

This software package is a set of utilities aimed to analyse trajectories
of coarse-grained simulations. It works with
\href{https://github.com/olenz/vtfplugin/wiki/VTF-format}{vtf trajectory
files}.

The emphasis is mainly on assembly of molecules, e.g., self-assembly of
polymers. It therefore includes utilities to determine if molecules are in
aggregates and to calculate various properties of aggregates. Also,
throughout the utilities and this manual, the term aggregates refers to any
supramolecular structure (e.g., a bilayer, a micelle, or a vesicle).  The
package also contains some utilities to generate initial configurations (or
adapt existing configurations) as well as to create input files for the
\href{https://lammps.sandia.gov/}{LAMMPS molecular dynamic simulator} and
the
\href{https://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/DL_MESO.aspx}{DL\_MESO
simulation package}.

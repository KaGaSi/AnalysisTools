\chapter{Introdution}

This software package is a set of utilities aimed to analyse trajectories
of coarse-grained simulations. It was initially developed to work with
\href{http://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk//research/app/ccg/software/DL_MESO/40694.aspx}{DL\_MESO
simulation package}. However, it works with
\href{https://github.com/olenz/vtfplugin/wiki/VTF-format}{vtf trajectory
files}, so it can be used to analyse any \texttt{vtf} trajectories.

The emphasis is placed on assembly of molecules, e.i., self-assembly of
polymers. It therefore include utilities to determine if molecules are in
aggregates and to calculate various properties of aggregates.  The
utilities only calculate desired quantities and write them to output text
files, there is no plotting or visualisation.

Examples of the resulting data can be seen in the author's thesis

\chapter{Introdution}

\section{General Information}
AnalysisTools is a set of utilities to (mainly) analyse trajectories of
particle-based simulations. The 34 utilities (including one
from the \href{https://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/DL_MESO.aspx}{DL\_MESO
simulation package} could be roughly divided into four types:

\begin{itemize}
  \item utilities to calculate system-wide properties; e.g., pair
    correlation functions or particle densities along a simulation box axis
  \item utilities to calculate per-molecule or per-aggregate properties
    (where aggregate stands for any supramolecular structure); e.g., shape
    descriptors for individual molecules or whole micelles
  \item utilities to manipulate a configuration; e.g., create initial
    configuration for a simulation from scratch or by adding molecules to
    an existing one
  \item helper utilities to analyse text files; e.g., calculate averages
    and standard deviations of a data series
\end{itemize}

\section{Installation}

AnalysisTools requires \tt{C} and \tt{Fortran} compilers and \tt{cmake}.
The compilation should be done in a separate directory, such as
\tt{<root>/build} (where \tt{<root>} is the AnalysisTools root
directory). The following generates a \tt{Makefile} within \tt{build}:

\tt{mkdir <root>/build; cd <root>/build; cmake ../}

Then run \tt{make} to compile all utilities or \tt{make <utility name>} to
compile a single utility.

The binaries are located in the \tt{<root>build/bin} directory.

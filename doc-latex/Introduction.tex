\chapter{Introdution}

This software package is a set of utilities aimed to analyse trajectories
of coarse-grained simulations. It was initially developed to work with
\href{http://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk//research/app/ccg/software/DL_MESO/40694.aspx}{DL\_MESO
simulation package}. However, it works with
\href{https://github.com/olenz/vtfplugin/wiki/VTF-format}{vtf trajectory
files}, so it can be used to analyse any \texttt{vtf} trajectories.

The emphasis is mainly on assembly of molecules, e.g., self-assembly of
polymers. It therefore includes utilities to determine if molecules are in
aggregates and to calculate various properties of aggregates. Also,
throughout the utilities and this manual, the term aggregates refers to any
supramolecular structure (such as, e.g., a bilayer).

However, the package also contains some utilities to generate initial
configurations (or adapt existing configurations) as well as to create a
data file from \texttt{vtf} trajectories for the
\href{https://lammps.sandia.gov/}{LAMMPS molecular dynamic simulator}.

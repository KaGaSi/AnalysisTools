\section{BondLength} \label{sec:BondLength}

\TODO{Completely rewrite\ldots}

This utility calculates a distribution of bond lengths in specified
molecule type(s). It can also calculate a distribution of distances between
any two beads in the molecules.

For each of the specified molecule type(s), \texttt{BondLength} calculates
bond lengths between all different types of connected bead pairs.
For example, assume two linear molecule types \texttt{Mol\_1} and
\texttt{Mol\_2}, both composed of bead types \texttt{A} and \texttt{B}.
\texttt{Mol\_1} is connected like this: \texttt{A-A-B}; \texttt{Mol\_2}
like this: \texttt{A-B-B}. If both molecule types are used,
\texttt{BondLength} calculates for each molecule type distribution of
lengths for bonds \texttt{A-A}, \texttt{A-B}, and \texttt{B-B} (separate
for each molecule even though the molecules share the same bead types).

To calculate the distribution of distances between specific (possibly
unconnected) beads in a molecule, use \texttt{-d} option which takes as
arguments pairs of bead indices (according to the order of beads in the
molecule in \texttt{vsf} -- similarly to the \texttt{-n} option in
\texttt{AngleMolecules}, i.e., Section~\ref{sec:AngleMolecules}). More than
one pair can be specified.  These indices are the same for all \texttt{<mol
name(s)>}. If an index higher than the number of beads in the molecule is
provided, the utility takes the last bead of the molecule (i.e., the
highest index). For example, using \texttt{-d file.txt 1 2 1 9999} would
write two distributions for each \texttt{<mol name(s)>} into
\texttt{<file.txt>}: distribution of distances between the first and the
second bead in each \texttt{<mol name(s)>} and between the first bead and
the last one (or the 9999th bead).

In both cases, \texttt{BondLength} appends at the end of the file minimum and
maximum bond lengths/distances.

Format of output files:
\begin{enumerate}[nosep,leftmargin=20pt]
  \item \texttt{<output>} -- distribution of bond length between all bead
    pairs
    \begin{itemize}[nosep,leftmargin=5pt]
      \item first line: command used to generate the file
      \item second line: column headers
        \begin{itemize}[nosep,leftmargin=10pt]
          \item first is the centre of each bin (governed by
            \texttt{<width>}); i.e., if \texttt{<width>} is 0.1,
            then the centre of bin 0 to 0.1 is 0.05, centre of bin 0.1 to
            0.2 is 0.15, etc.
          \item the rest are for the calculated data: for each molecule type,
            there is a list of column numbers corresponding to all
            possible bead type pairs in the molecule; if no beads of the
            given types are connected, the data column contains \texttt{nan}
        \end{itemize}
      \item next lines: the calculated data
      \item second to last line: column headers for minimal and maximal bond
        lengths
        \begin{itemize}[nosep,leftmargin=10pt]
          \item for each molecule, all the possible beads pairs are again listed
          \item for each pair, the column number corresponds to the minimum,
            while the next column is always the maximum
        \end{itemize}
      \item last line: commented out (i.e., the line starts with \texttt{\#})
        minimal and maximal bond lengths
    \end{itemize}
  \item \texttt{-d <output> <ints>} -- distribution of distances between
    specified beads
    \begin{itemize}[nosep,leftmargin=5pt]
      \item first line: command used to generate the file
      \item second line: order of beads (given only by bead names) in each
        molecule
      \item third line: column headers
        \begin{itemize}[nosep,leftmargin=10pt]
          \item first is again the centre of every bin
          \item the rest are for the calculated data: for each molecule type,
            there is a list of column numbers corresponding to the given
            pairs of bead indices in the molecule (and to the \texttt{-d}
            option's arguments); the numbers also correspond to the order of
            beads in the previous line
        \end{itemize}
      \item next lines: the calculated data
      \item second to last line: column headers for minimal and maximal bond
        lengths
        \begin{itemize}[nosep,leftmargin=10pt]
          \item for each molecule, all the possible beads pairs are again listed
          \item for each pair, the column number corresponds to the minimum,
            while the next column is always the maximum

      \item last line: commented out (i.e., the line starts with \texttt{\#})
        minimal and maximal bond lengths

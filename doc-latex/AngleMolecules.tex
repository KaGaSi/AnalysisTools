\section{AngleMolecules} \label{sec:AngleMolecules}

This utility calculates angles between beads in each molecule of specified
molecule type(s). The beads do not have to be connected, so the angle does
not have to be between two bonds.

The angle is specified by three bead indices taken from the \texttt{vsf}
file (\texttt{-n} option) These indices are from 1 to $N$, where $N$ is the
number of beads in the molecule type. Generally, the numbering of beads
inside a molecule is made according to the first molecule of the given type
in \texttt{vsf} file. For example, assume that beads of the first molecule
called \texttt{mol} in the \texttt{vsf} file are ordered \texttt{A}
(\texttt{vsf} index 123), \texttt{B} (\texttt{vsf} index 124), \texttt{C}
(\texttt{vsf} index 200). Then, bead \texttt{A} is 1, bead \texttt{B} is 2,
and \texttt{C} is 3.

More than one angle can be specified
(i.e., a multiple of three numbers have to be supplied to the \texttt{-n}
option.). For example, assuming indices \texttt{1 2 3} are specified
(default if \texttt{-n} option is not used), the angle will be between
lines defined by beads with indices \texttt{1 2} and \texttt{2 3}. The
angle is calculated in degrees and is between 0 and 180$^{\circ}$.

The utility calculates distribution of angles for each specified trio of
bead indices for each molecule type and prints overall averages at the end
of \texttt{<output>} file. If \texttt{-a} option is used, it can also write
all the angles for all individual molecules in each timestep (i.e., time
evolution of the angle for each individual molecule).

Usage:

\noindent
\texttt{AngleMolecules <input> <mol name(s)> <options>}

\begin{longtable}{p{0.19\textwidth}p{0.754\textwidth}}
  \toprule
  \multicolumn{2}{l}{Mandatory arguments} \\
  \midrule
  \texttt{<input>} & input coordinate file (either \texttt{vcf} or
    \texttt{vtf} format) \\
  \texttt{<mol name(s)>} & molecule name(s) to calculcate angles for \\
  \texttt{<output>} & output file for distribution \\
  \toprule
  \multicolumn{2}{l}{Non-standard options} \\
  \midrule
  \texttt{--joined} & specify that \texttt{<input>} contains joined
    coordinates (i.e., periodic boundary conditions for molecules do not
    have to be removed) \\
  \texttt{-a <name>} & write all angles for all molecules in all timesteps
    to \texttt{<name>} \\
  \texttt{-n  <ints>} & multiple of three indices for angle calculation (default: 1 2 3) \\
  \texttt{-st <int>} & starting timestep for calculation (default: 1) \\
  \bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Format of output files:
\begin{enumerate}[nosep,leftmargin=20pt]
  \item \texttt{<output>} -- distribution of angles
    \begin{itemize}[nosep,leftmargin=5pt]
      \item first line: command used to generate the file
      \item second line: planes to calculate angles between (the
        dash-separated numbers correspond to indices inside every molecule
        and are the same as the arguments to the \texttt{-n} option) with
        the numbers in brackets corresponding to $n$th column of data for
        each molecule type
      \item third line: numbering of columns (i.e., column headers)
        \begin{itemize}[nosep,leftmargin=10pt]
          \item first is the centre of each bin in angles (governed by
            \texttt{<width>}); i.e., if \texttt{<width>} is 5$^{\circ}$,
            then the centre of bin 0 to 5$^{\circ}$ is 2.5, centre of bin 5
            to 10$^{\circ}$ is 7.5 and so on
          \item the rest are for the calculated data: the range for each
            molecule type specifies which column numbers correspond to the
            calculated angles for that particular molecule type and the
            order of angles is given by the second line
        \end{itemize}
      \item last two lines: arithmetic means for each calculated angle
        (last line) and headers (second to last line) that again give range
        of columns in the last line for each molecule type
    \end{itemize}
  \item \texttt{-a <name>} -- all angles for all molecules in all timesteps
  \begin{itemize}[nosep,leftmargin=5pt]
    \item first and second lines are the same as for \texttt{<output>}
    \item third lines: column headers
      \begin{itemize}[nosep,leftmargin=10pt]
        \item first is simulation timestep
        \item the rest are the calculated data: the range for each molecule
          type corresponds to the number of molecules of the given type
          times the number of calculated angles; for each molecule the
          angles are ordered according to the second line
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

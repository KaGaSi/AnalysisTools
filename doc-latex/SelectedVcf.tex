\section{SelectedVcf} \label{sec:SelectedVcf}

This utility creates a new \texttt{vcf} coordinate file containing only
beads of specified types with an option of removing periodic boundary
conditions (i.e., joining molecules).

The selected bead types are printed as comments at the beginning of the
output \texttt{vcf} file.

Also, specified molecules can be excluded which is useful when the same
bead type is shared between more molecule types. However, as of now, no
utilities can read a \texttt{vcf} file that does not contain all beads of a
given type, so this can be used only for vmd visualization.

Lastly, \texttt{xyz} coordinate file can also be created from the selected
bead type(s).

Usage:

\noindent
\texttt{SelectedVcf <input> <output> <bead type(s)> <options>}

\begin{longtable}{p{0.22\textwidth}p{0.724\textwidth}}
  \toprule
  \multicolumn{2}{l}{Mandatory arguments} \\
  \midrule
  \texttt{<input>} & input coordinate file (either \texttt{vcf} or
    \texttt{vtf} format) \\
  \texttt{<output.vcf>} & output \texttt{vcf} coordinate file with indexed
    coordinates \\
  \texttt{<bead type(s)>} & bead type names to save (can be omitted if
    \texttt{-r} is used) \\
  \toprule
  \multicolumn{2}{l}{Non-standard options} \\
  \midrule
  \texttt{-r} & reverse function, i.e., exclude \texttt{<bead type(s)>}
    instead of including them; if no \texttt{<bead type(s)>} are specified,
    all bead types are used (requires \texttt{<input>} with all bead types) \\
  \texttt{--join} & join molecules by removing periodic boundary conditions \\
  \texttt{-st <int>} & starting timestep for calculation (default: 1) \\
  \texttt{-sk <int>} & number of steps skip per one used (default: 0) \\
  \texttt{-x <name(s)>} & exclude molecules of specified name(s) -- do not
    use if \texttt{output.vcf} is further analysed \\
  \texttt{-xyz <name>} & save coordinates to \texttt{xyz} file -- does not
    take into account \texttt{-x} option \\
  \bottomrule
\end{longtable}

AnalysisTools documentation
===========================

AnalysisTools is a set of utilities to manipulate trajectories from
particle-based simulations. Currently, there are 37 utilities (including one
adapted from `DL_MESO <https://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/DL_MESO.aspx>`_) ranging
from calculating global or local properties (such as pair correlation functions
or per-molecule/per-aggregate shape descriptors) to generating/tweaking initial
configurations for new simulations

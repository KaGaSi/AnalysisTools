Welcome to AnalysisTools's documentation
=========================================

AnalysisTools is a suite of utilities to (mainly) analyse particle-based
simulations. Roughly speaking, there are three types of utilities:

* utilities to calculate system-wide properties; e.g., pair correlation
  functions or particle density along a simulation box axis
* utilities to calculate per-molecule or per-aggregate properties (where
  aggregate stands for any supramolecular structure); e.g., shape
  descriptors for individual molecules or whole micelles
* utilities to manipulate a configuration; e.g., create initial
  configuration for a simulation from scratch or by adding molecules to an
  existing one
